# PITT-Notes

JPA MySQL Server, a JAX-RS REST API, and a simplistic android app interface created as a submission the the 2018 PITT Mobile App Challenge. 

The focus of this project was the backend server in order to learn and gain a better understanding of Java EE. The android app side of this project was only developed to provide an mobile interface to demonstrate the backend, and was my first exposure to developing for Android.
